Reset-MSTeamsAddinForOutlook:

does look for the .msi of the addin from the installed MsTeams (Work or School) client, then, match the version to latest available then unbucket & run localyl in from temp folder.

I use the chocolatey community package to install the MsTeams (Work or School) in case is missing.
