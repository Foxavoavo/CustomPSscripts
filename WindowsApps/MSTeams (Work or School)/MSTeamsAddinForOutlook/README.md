Reset-MSTeamsAddinForOutlook:

the script does look for the Outlook add-in .msi from new teams in 'C:\Program Files\WindowsApps' folder then re-run the .msi.

I gather the add-in stack and add the content to the standard folders.

If the New Teams Windows app is not in the device, I use the chocolatey community package to install the MsTeams (Work or School) in case is missing.
